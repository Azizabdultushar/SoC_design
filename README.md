# SoC Design

SoC and SoC-based designs become popular day by day. It became a major sub area within embedded systems development.
transistor >> Integrated circuit(IC) >> Functional block (FSM)>> IP >> SoC
## SoC : Snapdragon 810 : Apple 12 :: Exynos 4720
## Advantages: 
- Space
- Power
- Performance
- cost
- Reliability
- Security
## Disadvantages: 
- Single point of failure
- NRE cost is higher
- Much more difficult to design/verify/test.

## SoC design is based on HW/SW co-design.

## Traditional SoCs: As like snapdragon, apple.
